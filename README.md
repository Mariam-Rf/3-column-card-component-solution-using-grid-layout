## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use grid layout. It's a little bit harder than flexbox layout, but I think it works better for more complex layouts than this simple one
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.cards-container {
  width: 70%;
  min-width: 50%;
  height: 80vh;
  max-height: 75vh;
  padding: 2%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
```
